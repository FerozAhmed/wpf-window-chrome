## WPF Window Chrome
---

#### Author: [Charlie Robbins](http://www.charlierobbins.com)

This is an implementation of a custom Window control that is designed to work well with [Custom Window Chrome](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/chrome) in WPF. There are template parts for all Window buttons (Minimize, Maximize, Close) as well as supporting all native windowing features (such as SizeToContent).

Sample usage is included in the project. If you have any questions, please email me: charlie[dot]robbins[at]gmail[dot]com.
